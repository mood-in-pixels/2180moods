        <div class="card card-body">

				<p>Color psychology – the idea that color affects your behavior and mood. We've all probably heard or felt when seeing the color <span class="text-danger">Red</span>, a sense of aggression. Or when seeing ,<span class="text-success"> green</span> is restorative, etc. — is based in part on color investigations by the mid-century artist Josef Albers, a professor at Bauhaus and later at Yale University. This line of inquiry later found its place in pop-culture where color psychology took on a new conceptual interpretations, branching fromthe study of perception itself.  Yet, on either side of the color wheel, it’s still not clear why certain colors affect us in certain ways.</p>

				<p>Theorists hold that the focus of colors are to react to each other, not channel a prescribed emotion. Kevin Connolly, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania states.</p>

				<blockquote class="blockquote"> The hard part about assigning certain emotions to certain colors is that color never exists on its own. It always appears with other colors around it. It’s hard – impossible, really – to isolate a color as an emotional trigger. </blockquote>

				<p> For researchers like Connely, this points to the notion that our sense of color is deeply integrated with your other senses. </p>

        <p>Keeping tabs on the things you feel lucky to have in your life is a great way to boost your mood.</p>

        <p>In a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-improve-your-relationship-2014-12" target="_blank">recent study</a> from psychologists at UC Davis, researchers had 3 groups of volunteers keep weekly journals focused on a single topic. While one group wrote about major events that had happened that week, the second group wrote about hassles they'd experienced, and the last group wrote about things they were grateful for.</p>

        <p>Ten weeks later, those in the gratitude-journal group reported feeling more optimistic and more satisfied with their lives than those in any of the other groups and reported fewer physical symptoms of discomfort, from runny noses to headaches.</p>

        <p>Ever heard someone say, 'If you're angry at someone, write them a letter and don't send it'? While that might seem like a waste of time, science reveals recording your feelings is great for clarifying your thoughts, solving problems more efficiently, relieving stress, and more. A team of psychologists recently hit on a neurological reason behind why this simple act might help us overcome some emotional distress.</p>

        <p>The researchers studied brain scans of volunteers who recorded an emotional experience for 20 minutes a day for 4 sessions. They then compared the brain scans with volunteers who wrote down a neutral experience for the same amount of time. The brain scans of the first group showed neural activity in a part of the brain responsible for dampening strong emotional feelings, suggesting that the act of recording their experience calmed them. This same neural activity was absent in the volunteers who recorded a neutral experience.</p>

        <p><em>
        When you experience a negative shift in your mood, you can pause and ask yourself the following questions...</em></p>
        <ul> • What was happening right before I started to feel this way? (who, what, when, where)</ul>
        <ul> • What thoughts or images were going through my mind?</ul>
        <ul> • What was the specific thought or conclusion that I came to that lowered my mood or upset me?</ul>
        <p>After identifying that thought, it’s important to evaluate it for any thinking traps. Thinking traps are ways in which we convince ourselves that something is true or rational, when in fact it is not. By eliminating traps from our thinking, we are able to positively influence our emotions and behaviors.</p>

        <p>For example, you might learn that you are falling in the catastrophizing trap. That is, you are blowing a situation out of proportion or seeing it in the worst possible way.
        </p>
        <p><em>To shift your thinking and get out of the catastrophizing thinking trap, you might ask yourself...</em></p>
        
        <ul> • Is the situation as bad as I’m making it out to be?</ul>
        <ul> • Have I been able to handle something like this in the past?</ul>
        <p><em>Then consider…</em></p>
        <ul> • What’s a healthier way that I can think about this?</ul>
        <p>By answering these questions, you can replace your original thought with something more accurate and rational. Your mood will improve and you’ll begin to see how you can break free from thought traps that might be common to you.</p>

      <div class="card card-header"><h3 class="articleTitle">Successful change comes only in stages. How long it takes is an individual matter.<h3>
      </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="card card-body">
<p>Considerable research has sought to identify factors that contribute to successful behavior change and to develop more effective tools for clinicians to encourage their patients to adopt healthier habits, especially in the context of a brief office visit. One potential roadblock: too often we're motivated by negatives such as guilt, fear, or regret. Experts agree that long-lasting change is most likely when it's self-motivated and rooted in positive thinking. For example, in an analysis of 129 studies of behavior change strategies, a British research group found that the least effective approaches were those that encouraged a sense of fear or regret. Studies have also shown that goals are easier to reach if they're specific ("I'll walk for 30 minutes every day," rather than "I'll get more exercise"). You should also limit the number of goals you're trying to reach; otherwise, you may overtax your attention and willpower. And it's not enough just to have a goal; you need to have practical ways of reaching it. For example, if you are trying to quit smoking, have a plan for quelling the urge to smoke (for example, keep a bottle of water nearby, chew sugarless gum, or practice deep breathing).</p>

<!-- <p><strong>Change is a process, not an event</strong>
<br><ul>Research has produced several models that help account for success and failure and explain why making healthy changes can take so long. The one most widely applied and tested in health settings is the transtheoretical model (TTM). Developed in the 1980s by alcoholism researchers James O. Prochaska and Carlo C. DiClemente, TTM presupposes that at any given time, a person is in one of five stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, or maintenance.</p>

<p>The idea is that each stage is a preparation for the following one, so you mustn't hurry through or skip stages. Also, different approaches and strategies (called "processes of change" in the TTM model) are needed at different stages. For example, a smoker who's at the precontemplation stage — that is, not even thinking about quitting — probably isn't ready to make a list of alternatives to smoking.</p>

<p>Most of the evidence for this model comes from studies of alcohol use, drug abuse, and smoking cessation, but it's also been applied to other health-related behaviors, including exercise and dieting. Clinicians and health educators use TTM to counsel patients, but you don't need to be an expert; anyone motivated to change can use this model. Here is a description of the stages of change and some ideas about how people move through them:</p></ul></p>

<p><ul><em><strong>Precontemplation.</strong></em> <br>At this stage, you have no conscious intention of making a change, whether it's because you lack awareness or information ("Overweight in my family is genetic; it's just the way we are") or because you've failed in the past and feel demoralized ("I've tried so many times to lose weight; it's hopeless"). People in this stage tend to avoid reading, talking, or thinking about the unhealthy behavior, but their awareness and interest may be sparked by outside influences, such as public information campaigns, stories in the media, illnesses, or concern from a clinician, friend, or family member. To move past precontemplation, you need to sense that the unhealthy behavior is blocking your access to important personal goals, such as being healthy enough to travel or enjoy children or grandchildren.</ul></p>

<p><ul><em><strong>Contemplation.</strong></em> <br> In some programs and studies that employ TTM, people who say they're considering a change in the next six months are classified as contemplators. In reality, people often vacillate for much longer than that. At this stage, you're aware that the behavior is a problem, but you still haven't made a commitment to take action. Ambivalence may lead you to weigh and re-weigh the benefits and costs: "If I stop smoking, I'll lose that hacking cough, but I know I'll gain weight," or "I know smoking could give me lung cancer, but it helps me relax; if I quit, the stress could kill me, too!"</p>

<p>Health educators have several ways of helping people move on to the next stage. One strategy is to make a list of the pros and cons, then examine the barriers (the cons) and think about how to overcome them. For example, many women find it difficult to get regular exercise because it's inconvenient or they have too little time. If finding a 30-minute block of time to exercise is a barrier, how about two 15-minute sessions? Could someone else cook dinner so you can take a walk after work? If you feel too self-conscious to take an exercise class, what about using an exercise video at home?</p></ul></p>

<p><ul><em><strong>Preparation.</strong></em> <br> At this stage, you know you must change, believe you can, and are making plans to do so soon. You've taken some initial steps — perhaps joined a health club, bought a supply of nicotine patches, or added a calorie-counting book to the kitchen shelf. At this stage, it's important to anticipate obstacles. If you're preparing to cut down on alcohol, for example, be aware of situations that provoke unhealthy drinking, and plan ways around them. If work stress triggers end-of-day drinking, plan to take a walk when you get home. If preparing dinner makes you want a drink, plan to have seltzer water instead of wine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, create an action plan with realistic goals. If you've been sedentary and want to exercise more, you might start with a goal of avoiding the elevator for two-, three-, or four-floor trips. Or plan to walk 15 minutes every day. Then you can work your way up to more ambitious goals.</p></ul></p>

<p><ul><em><strong>Action.</strong></em><br> At this stage, you've changed — stopped smoking, for example (according to Prochaska, merely cutting down would not be "action" but preparation for action) — and you've begun to face the challenges of life without the old behavior. You'll need to practice the alternatives you identified during the preparation stage. For example, if stress tempts you to eat, you can use healthy coping strategies such as yoga, deep breathing, or exercise. At this stage, it's important to be clear about your motivation; if necessary, write down your reasons for making the change and read them every day. Engage in positive "self-talk" to bolster your resolve. Get support. Let others who care about you know that you're making a change.</ul></p>

<p><ul><em><strong>Maintenance.</strong></em> <br>Once you've practiced the new behavior for six months, you're in the maintenance stage. Now your focus shifts to integrating the change into your life and preventing relapse. That may require other changes, especially avoiding situations or triggers associated with the old habit. It can be tough, especially if it means steering clear of certain activities or friends.</p></ul>
<br>
<p>Research has shown that you will rarely progress through the stages of change in a straightforward, linear way. Relapse and recycling are common, though you usually don't go back to square one. The spiral model suggests that relapses provide opportunities to learn what didn't work and make different plans for the next "round."

<p>The path between stages is rarely straightforward. Most people relapse at some point and recycle through one or more stages (see the illustration, "Spiral model of the stages of change"). For example, if you relapse during the maintenance stage, you may find yourself back at the contemplation or preparation stage. One study found that smokers cycled through the "action" stage three or four times, on average, before they succeeded in quitting.</p>

<p>Relapse is common, perhaps even inevitable. You should regard it as an integral part of the process. Think of it this way: you learn something about yourself each time you relapse. Maybe the strategy you adopted didn't fit into your life or suit your priorities. Next time, you can use what you learned, make adjustments, and be a little ahead of the game as you continue on the path to change.</p>
