          </div>
          <div class="card card-body">
            <p>Color psychology – the idea that color affects your behavior and mood. We've all probably heard or felt when seeing the color <span class="text-danger">Red</span>, a sense of aggression. Or when seeing , <span class="text-success">green</span> is restorative, etc. — is based in part on color investigations by the mid-century artist Josef Albers, a professor at Bauhaus and later at Yale University. This line of inquiry later found its place in pop-culture where color psychology took on a new conceptual interpretations, branching fromthe study of perception itself. Yet, on either side of the color wheel, it’s still not clear why certain colors affect us in certain ways.</p>
            <p>Theorists hold that the focus of colors are to react to each other, not channel a prescribed emotion. Kevin Connolly, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania states.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              The hard part about assigning certain emotions to certain colors is that color never exists on its own. It always appears with other colors around it. It’s hard – impossible, really – to isolate a color as an emotional trigger.
            </blockquote>
            <p>For researchers like Connely, this points to the notion that our sense of color is deeply integrated with your other senses.</p><a href="https://whyy.org/segments/how-emotions-ideas-and-senses-affect-our-perception-of-color/" role="button" target="_blank">...Read more</a><br>

            <p>Keeping tabs on the things you feel lucky to have in your life is a great way to boost your mood.</p>
            <p>In a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-improve-your-relationship-2014-12" target="_blank">recent study</a> from psychologists at UC Davis, researchers had 3 groups of volunteers keep weekly journals focused on a single topic. While one group wrote about major events that had happened that week, the second group wrote about hassles they'd experienced, and the last group wrote about things they were grateful for.</p>
            <p>Ten weeks later, those in the gratitude-journal group reported feeling more optimistic and more satisfied with their lives than those in any of the other groups and reported fewer physical symptoms of discomfort, from runny noses to headaches.</p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/simple-ways-to-improve-your-mood-according-to-psychologists/#25-write-down-3-things-youre-grateful-for-1" role="button" target="_blank">...Read more</a><br>

            <p>Ever heard someone say, 'If you're angry at someone, write them a letter and don't send it'? While that might seem like a waste of time, science reveals recording your feelings is great for clarifying your thoughts, solving problems more efficiently, relieving stress, and more. A team of psychologists recently hit on a neurological reason behind why this simple act might help us overcome some emotional distress.</p>
            <p>The researchers studied brain scans of volunteers who recorded an emotional experience for 20 minutes a day for 4 sessions. They then compared the brain scans with volunteers who wrote down a neutral experience for the same amount of time. The brain scans of the first group showed neural activity in a part of the brain responsible for dampening strong emotional feelings, suggesting that the act of recording their experience calmed them. This same neural activity was absent in the volunteers who recorded a neutral experience.</p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/simple-ways-to-improve-your-mood-according-to-psychologists/#13-write-down-your-feelings-13" role="button" target="_blank">...Read more</a><br>

          <div class="card card-body">
            <p><em>When you experience a negative shift in your mood, you can pause and ask yourself the following questions...</em></p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em">
              • What was happening right before I started to feel this way? (who, what, when, where)
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em">
              • What thoughts or images were going through my mind?
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em">
              • What was the specific thought or conclusion that I came to that lowered my mood or upset me?
            </div>
            <p>After identifying that thought, it’s important to evaluate it for any thinking traps. Thinking traps are ways in which we convince ourselves that something is true or rational, when in fact it is not. By eliminating traps from our thinking, we are able to positively influence our emotions and behaviors.</p>
            <p>For example, you might learn that you are falling in the catastrophizing trap. That is, you are blowing a situation out of proportion or seeing it in the worst possible way.</p>
            <p><em>To shift your thinking and get out of the catastrophizing thinking trap, you might ask yourself...</em></p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em">
              • Is the situation as bad as I’m making it out to be?
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em">
              • Have I been able to handle something like this in the past?
            </div>
            <p><em>Then consider…</em></p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em">
              • What’s a healthier way that I can think about this?
            </div>
            <p>By answering these questions, you can replace your original thought with something more accurate and rational. Your mood will improve and you’ll begin to see how you can break free from thought traps that might be common to you.</p>

            <h3 class="articleTitle" id="a5">Successful change comes only in stages. How long it takes is an individual matter.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="card card-body">
            <p>Considerable research has sought to identify factors that contribute to successful behavior change and to develop more effective tools for clinicians to encourage their patients to adopt healthier habits, especially in the context of a brief office visit. One potential roadblock: too often we're motivated by negatives such as guilt, fear, or regret. Experts agree that long-lasting change is most likely when it's self-motivated and rooted in positive thinking. For example, in an analysis of 129 studies of behavior change strategies, a British research group found that the least effective approaches were those that encouraged a sense of fear or regret. Studies have also shown that goals are easier to reach if they're specific ("I'll walk for 30 minutes every day," rather than "I'll get more exercise"). You should also limit the number of goals you're trying to reach; otherwise, you may overtax your attention and willpower. And it's not enough just to have a goal; you need to have practical ways of reaching it. For example, if you are trying to quit smoking, have a plan for quelling the urge to smoke (for example, keep a bottle of water nearby, chew sugarless gum, or practice deep breathing).</p>
            <!-- <p><strong>Change is a process, not an event</strong>
            <br><ul>Research has produced several models that help account for success and failure and explain why making healthy changes can take so long. The one most widely applied and tested in health settings is the transtheoretical model (TTM). Developed in the 1980s by alcoholism researchers James O. Prochaska and Carlo C. DiClemente, TTM presupposes that at any given time, a person is in one of five stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, or maintenance.</p>

            <p>The idea is that each stage is a preparation for the following one, so you mustn't hurry through or skip stages. Also, different approaches and strategies (called "processes of change" in the TTM model) are needed at different stages. For example, a smoker who's at the precontemplation stage — that is, not even thinking about quitting — probably isn't ready to make a list of alternatives to smoking.</p>

            <p>Most of the evidence for this model comes from studies of alcohol use, drug abuse, and smoking cessation, but it's also been applied to other health-related behaviors, including exercise and dieting. Clinicians and health educators use TTM to counsel patients, but you don't need to be an expert; anyone motivated to change can use this model. Here is a description of the stages of change and some ideas about how people move through them:</p></ul></p>

            <p><ul><em><strong>Precontemplation.</strong></em> <br>At this stage, you have no conscious intention of making a change, whether it's because you lack awareness or information ("Overweight in my family is genetic; it's just the way we are") or because you've failed in the past and feel demoralized ("I've tried so many times to lose weight; it's hopeless"). People in this stage tend to avoid reading, talking, or thinking about the unhealthy behavior, but their awareness and interest may be sparked by outside influences, such as public information campaigns, stories in the media, illnesses, or concern from a clinician, friend, or family member. To move past precontemplation, you need to sense that the unhealthy behavior is blocking your access to important personal goals, such as being healthy enough to travel or enjoy children or grandchildren.</ul></p>

            <p><ul><em><strong>Contemplation.</strong></em> <br> In some programs and studies that employ TTM, people who say they're considering a change in the next six months are classified as contemplators. In reality, people often vacillate for much longer than that. At this stage, you're aware that the behavior is a problem, but you still haven't made a commitment to take action. Ambivalence may lead you to weigh and re-weigh the benefits and costs: "If I stop smoking, I'll lose that hacking cough, but I know I'll gain weight," or "I know smoking could give me lung cancer, but it helps me relax; if I quit, the stress could kill me, too!"</p>

            <p>Health educators have several ways of helping people move on to the next stage. One strategy is to make a list of the pros and cons, then examine the barriers (the cons) and think about how to overcome them. For example, many women find it difficult to get regular exercise because it's inconvenient or they have too little time. If finding a 30-minute block of time to exercise is a barrier, how about two 15-minute sessions? Could someone else cook dinner so you can take a walk after work? If you feel too self-conscious to take an exercise class, what about using an exercise video at home?</p></ul></p>

            <p><ul><em><strong>Preparation.</strong></em> <br> At this stage, you know you must change, believe you can, and are making plans to do so soon. You've taken some initial steps — perhaps joined a health club, bought a supply of nicotine patches, or added a calorie-counting book to the kitchen shelf. At this stage, it's important to anticipate obstacles. If you're preparing to cut down on alcohol, for example, be aware of situations that provoke unhealthy drinking, and plan ways around them. If work stress triggers end-of-day drinking, plan to take a walk when you get home. If preparing dinner makes you want a drink, plan to have seltzer water instead of wine.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, create an action plan with realistic goals. If you've been sedentary and want to exercise more, you might start with a goal of avoiding the elevator for two-, three-, or four-floor trips. Or plan to walk 15 minutes every day. Then you can work your way up to more ambitious goals.</p></ul></p>

            <p><ul><em><strong>Action.</strong></em><br> At this stage, you've changed — stopped smoking, for example (according to Prochaska, merely cutting down would not be "action" but preparation for action) — and you've begun to face the challenges of life without the old behavior. You'll need to practice the alternatives you identified during the preparation stage. For example, if stress tempts you to eat, you can use healthy coping strategies such as yoga, deep breathing, or exercise. At this stage, it's important to be clear about your motivation; if necessary, write down your reasons for making the change and read them every day. Engage in positive "self-talk" to bolster your resolve. Get support. Let others who care about you know that you're making a change.</ul></p>

            <p><ul><em><strong>Maintenance.</strong></em> <br>Once you've practiced the new behavior for six months, you're in the maintenance stage. Now your focus shifts to integrating the change into your life and preventing relapse. That may require other changes, especially avoiding situations or triggers associated with the old habit. It can be tough, especially if it means steering clear of certain activities or friends.</p></ul>
            <br>
            <p>Research has shown that you will rarely progress through the stages of change in a straightforward, linear way. Relapse and recycling are common, though you usually don't go back to square one. The spiral model suggests that relapses provide opportunities to learn what didn't work and make different plans for the next "round."

            <p>The path between stages is rarely straightforward. Most people relapse at some point and recycle through one or more stages (see the illustration, "Spiral model of the stages of change"). For example, if you relapse during the maintenance stage, you may find yourself back at the contemplation or preparation stage. One study found that smokers cycled through the "action" stage three or four times, on average, before they succeeded in quitting.</p>

            <p>Relapse is common, perhaps even inevitable. You should regard it as an integral part of the process. Think of it this way: you learn something about yourself each time you relapse. Maybe the strategy you adopted didn't fit into your life or suit your priorities. Next time, you can use what you learned, make adjustments, and be a little ahead of the game as you continue on the path to change.</p>

            <h3 class="articleTitle" id="a6">Three Factors of Habits</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="card card-body">
            <p>Examples of Triggers (cues) that make new habits stick explained by Charles Duhigg in a simple three-step process that all habits follow. This cycle, known as <em>The Habit Loop:</em></p>
            <ol>
              <li>The Trigger: the event that starts the habit.</li>
              <li>The Routine: the behavior that you perform, the habit itself.</li>
              <li>The Reward: the benefit that is associated with the behavior.</li>
            </ol>
            <br><h5><strong>Habit Triggers</strong></h5>
            <p>Each phase of the loop is important for building new habits, but today I’d like to discuss the first factor: habit triggers.</p>
            <p>There are five primary ways that a new habit can be triggered. If you understand each of them, then you can select the right one for the particular habit that you are working on. Here’s what you need to know about each trigger…</p>
            <br><h5><strong>Trigger 1: Time</strong></h5>
            <ul><p>Time is perhaps the most common way to trigger a new habit. Common morning habits are just one example. Waking up in the morning usually triggers a cascade of habits: go to the bathroom, take a shower, brush your teeth, get dressed, make a cup of coffee, etc.<br><br>
            There are also less commonly recognized ways that time triggers our behavior. For example, if you pay attention you may notice that you repeat certain tasks mindlessly at different points during the day: heading off to get a snack at the same time each afternoon, taking a smoking break at the same time each morning, and so on.<br><br>
            If these patterns are bad habits, then you may want to take stock of how you feel at this time of day. In many cases, your habits are a signal of how you feel. Bored? Maybe your afternoon snacking habit is a way of breaking up the monotony of the day. Feeling lonely? Maybe your smoking break is a way to connect with fellow co-workers. The point is, if you understand the reason why these habits pop up at the same time each day, then it can become easier to find a new habit to fill the void. Bad habits are replaced, not eliminated.<br>
            How I use it: Time-based triggers can also be used to stick with routines over and over again. This is my preferred method. For example, every Monday and Thursday I write a new article and post it on JamesClear.com. The time and date drive this pattern. It doesn’t matter how good or how bad I feel about the article. It doesn’t matter how long or how short the article is. All that matters is that I stick to the schedule. The time triggers the habit.</p></ul>
            <br><h5><strong>Trigger 2: Location</strong></h5>
            <ul><p>If you have ever walked into your kitchen, seen a plate of cookies on the counter, and eaten them just because they are there in front of you, then you understand the power of location on our behavior.<br><br>
            In my opinion, location (i.e. environment) is the most powerful driver of mindless habits and also the least recognized. In many cases, our habits and behaviors are simply a response to the environment that surrounds us. The famous study on water versus soft drink consumption is one example of how our environment can either promote good habits or lead us toward bad ones.<br><br>
            However, location-based triggers are not simply things we respond to, they can also be things we create. Multiple research studies by David Neal and Wendy Wood from Duke University have discovered that new habits are actually easier to perform in new locations.<br><br>
            One theory is that we mentally assign habits to a particular location. This means that all of the current places that you’re familiar with (your home, your office, etc.) already have behaviors, habits and routines assigned to them. If you want to build new habits in these familiar locations, then you need to overcome the triggers and cues that your brain has already assigned to that area. Meanwhile, building a new habit in a new location is like having a blank slate. You don’t have to overcome any pre-existing triggers.<br><br>
            <em>How I use it:</em> When I arrive at the gym, I head to the same spot each time to get ready, change into my lifting gear, and start my warm up. This location in the gym is a simple trigger that helps prompt my pre-workout routine (more on the power of a pre-game routine). There are bound to be some days when I don’t feel like exercising, but the location-based trigger helps me overcome that and get into my workout ritual as painlessly as possible.</p></ul>
            <br><h5><strong>Trigger 3: Preceding Event</strong></h5>
            <ul><p>Many habits are a response to something else that happens in your life. Your phone buzzes, so you pick it up to check your latest text message. The little notification bar lights up on Facebook, so you click it to see what it signals. These are examples of habits that are triggered by a preceding event.<br><br>
            When it comes to triggers that are useful for building new habits, I find preceding events to be one of the most useful. Once you understand habit stacking you can develop all sorts of ways to tie new habits into preceding events. (Example: “When I make my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for one minute.”)<br><br>
            <em>How I use it:</em> For over two years, I have used a preceding event to stick with a daily gratitude habit. Each night, when I sit down to eat dinner, I say one thing that I was grateful for that day. (It’s worth noting, one reason I believe I have been able to stick with this habit so consistently is because it is so small. The smaller the habit, the easier it is to build into your life.)</p></ul>
            <br><h5><strong>Trigger 4: Emotional State</strong></h5>
            <ul><p>In my experience, emotional state is a common trigger for bad habits. For example, you may have a habit of eating when you feel depressed. Or, you may default to online shopping when you feel bored. The emotional states of depression or boredom are triggers for these negative habits.<br><br>
            Unfortunately, although emotions are very common triggers for our behavior, I find that they are harder to control and utilize for building good habits. Mostly, I think this is because if you want an emotion to trigger a positive habit, then you often need to be consciously aware of the emotion as you are experiencing it. In other words, you have to be emotional and aware at the same time … and that can be hard to do. Paying attention is a powerful, but difficult, way to build better habits.<br><br>
            <em>How I use it:</em> I’m trying to get better about noticing when I am holding tension in my body and experiencing stress. When I do notice that I’m feeling particularly stressed, I’ll use this emotional state to trigger a deep breathing habit.<br><br>
            I like to follow a 3-1-5 breathing pattern: three seconds in, pause for one second, five seconds out. I’ll usually repeat this sequence three to five times. I find this little breathing exercise to be a great instant stress reliever. It’s particularly useful because you can literally do it anywhere.</p></ul>
            <br><h5><strong>Trigger 5: Other People</strong></h5>
            <ul><p>It is probably no surprise to you that the people you surround yourself with can play a role on your habits and behaviors. What may be a surprise is just how big of an impact these people can make. One study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that if your friend becomes obese, then your risk of obesity increases by 57 percent — even if your friend lives hundreds of miles away.<br><br>
            As far as I can tell, the best way to make use of this information is to surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. As Jim Rohn says, “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”<br><br>
            <em>How I use it:</em> I'm not a heavy drinker, but nearly every time I go out with friends I get a drink. Why is that? If I'm not yearning for a beer, why get one? It’s simply a response to the environment that I am in and the people I am around. The key is to choosing a successful trigger is to pick a trigger that is very specific and immediately actionable.</p>

        <p>Follow these simple tips to bring awareness to your action and make better decisions moving forward.</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You can't prevent negative thoughts:</strong> Stop trying. Wrestling with them only makes them worse.</li><br>
  <li><strong>The real problem is "fusion":</strong> When you treat your negative thoughts as indisputable facts and not merely ideas produced by your brain, that's when they cause problems.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Ask "What is my brain telling me right now?":</strong> Get some distance from your thoughts. Treat them as possibilities, not The Truth.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Ask "Is it useful?":</strong> Doesn't matter if they're true. It matters if the thoughts help you get where you want to go.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Over time, you want to make note of the thoughts you regularly fuse with. (Maybe it's "I can't handle this" or "I'm going to embarrass myself.") And then gently make fun of it: <em>Oh, so we're playing the “I’m not good enough” song again?</em></p>

<p>It takes practice to not get swept away by your thoughts. You're going to have to spend time at it. Maybe you're looking at all this mindfulness stuff right now and thinking, "I'll never be able to do this. I'm an idiot." No problem.</p>

<p>Take defusing to the meta-level. Say, "I notice I'm having the thought that I'll never be able to do this and I'm an idiot." Is that useful?</p>
